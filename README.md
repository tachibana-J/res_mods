# res_mods
## WoWS mods that I maintain:

1. Japanese text mod [/texts AND fontconfig.xml] (only .mo file in /texts is necessary):
    
    A. HUD UI elements (pulled from SEA client text file) are in Japanese;
    
    B. Asian ship names are displayed in Japanese (kanji with exception of ARP ships);
    
    C. Asian captain names are changed to those of historical figures, displayed in Japanese (kanji);
    
    D. Reworded certain features, including:

      a. Achievements: (to-do)
      
      b. リザーブ -> 営舎、エリア -> 海域、ゾーン -> 陣地、(etc.)
      
      c. Certain unnatural expressions: 配属する: -> 配属させる:
      
    E. Modules of Asian ships, mostly IJN for now, are changed to be as historically accurate as technically allowed:
    
      Exceptions: 古鷹の後期主砲、陽炎の主砲
      
    F. Easter egg(s?).

2. AP tracer color mod [/particles]: a simple recoloring of AP shell tracers to give a ice-blue for own shells and green for others' shells (friendly and hostile).
3. Flag mod [/content/gameplay/common/flags]: a shameless redo of a certain 2K flag mod, using historical navy flags of IJN and KM from Wikipedia.
4. Camouflage mod [/camouflages.xml AND /content/gameplay/common/camouflage]: a systematic recoloring of IJN "pickle-green" camos and others that I possess into more discreet versions. (pic to-do)
5. Dock mod [/spaces/Dock_ocean]: a simple tweak of the Ocean dock to allow better water/lighting/wind.
6. {WIP} Japanese font mod [/gui/flash/fonts_all.swf]: an on-the-fly swf resource replacement allowing better alphanumeric display with the default Japanese font; may bug out.
