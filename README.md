# res_mods
## WoWS mods that I maintain:

1. Japanese text mod `/texts` AND `fontconfig.xml` (only `global.mo` is necessary):
    
    &nbsp;&nbsp;A. HUD UI elements (pulled from SEA client text file) are in Japanese;
    
    &nbsp;&nbsp;B. Asian ship names are displayed in Japanese (kanji with exception of ARP ships);
    
    &nbsp;&nbsp;C. Asian captain names are changed to those of historical figures, displayed in Japanese (kanji);
    
    &nbsp;&nbsp;D. Reworded certain features, including:

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Achievements: **(to-do)**
    
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Signal flags
      
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. リザーブ → 営舎、エリア → 海域、ゾーン → 陣地、(etc.)
      
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. Certain unnatural expressions: 配属する: → 配属させる:
      
    &nbsp;&nbsp;E. Modules of Asian ships, mostly IJN for now, are changed to be as historically accurate as technically allowed:
    
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exceptions: 古鷹の後期主砲、陽炎の主砲
      
    &nbsp;&nbsp;F. Easter egg(s?).
    

2. AP tracer color mod `/particles`: a simple recoloring of AP shell tracers to give a ice-blue for own shells and green for others' shells (friendly and hostile).

3. Flag mod `/content/gameplay/common/flags`: a shameless redo of a certain 2K flag mod, using historical navy flags of IJN and KM from Wikipedia.

4. Camouflage mod `/camouflages.xml` AND `/content/gameplay/common/camouflage`: a systematic recoloring of IJN "pickle-green" camos and others that I possess into more discreet versions. **(pic to-do)**

5. Dock mod `/spaces/Dock_ocean`: a simple tweak of the Ocean dock to allow better water/lighting/wind.

6. {WIP} Japanese font mod `/gui/flash/fonts_all.swf`: an on-the-fly swf resource replacement allowing better alphanumeric display with the default Japanese font; may bug out.
