20160205 Custom fonts_all.swf Proof-of-Concept
---
* A custom `fonts_all.swf` is created with Adobe Flash Pro
* "Yu Go," a merged font-family between Yu Gothic and open-source Liberation Sans Narrow, is embeded in the swf
* The `fontconfig.xml` is changed to call upon the embeded font in the custom swf
* Ingame display of this font is anti-aliased, as opposed to modding `fontconfig.xml` to use system fonts
* Since `fonts_all.swf` must be hand-made individually for different fonts, improvement of this mod is request-based
* Specifics are detailed in readme so that user may make the flash file locally.
